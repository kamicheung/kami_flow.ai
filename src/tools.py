# K(X, Y) = <X, Y> / (||X||*||Y||)

# where X and Y are the two vectors being compared, <X, Y> is the dot product of X and Y, 
# and ||X|| and ||Y|| are the L2 norms of X and Y, respectively.
# computes similarity as the normalized dot product of X and Y, to scale for range -1 to 1 and to account for angle and magnitude difference (high variance)
# L2 is used because it is more sensistive to differences in the magnitude of the vector's components

# Pairwise computations are commonly used in machine learning and data analysis tasks, such as 
# clustering, classification, and dimensionality reduction. By computing the pairwise distances 
# or similarities between a set of vectors, it is possible to identify patterns and relationships 
# in the data that might not be apparent from a simple inspection of the vectors themselves.
